This was the \r\nearly 2000's so the software has evolved a great deal and my knowledge of both how to use the software \r\nand principles behind them continue to erode.  However, as I've recently tried to create some parts of \r\ninterest I am pleasantly surprised at how much I seem to remember from \"the good ole' days\".\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Project - Samsung Monitor Adapter\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n![Rendering](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jwmickey/printables/master/samsung-vesa-adapter/monitor-mount.jpg)\r\n\r\nI wanted to mount my Samsung 24\" monitor on the wall using a 75mm VESA mount, but the S24B350 does not \r\nhave a mounting pattern on the body of any kind.  This is a great monitor but if I had been smart enough \r\nto check for this feature before purchasing I would have passed.  I found a steel adapter from a 3rd party \r\nvendor that appears to be great, but I thought this would be a great opportunity to play around with \r\nsolid modeling again and finally have something worth of sending to a 3D printer!\r\n\r\nAfter my first attempt at printing the part, I have to say I'm pleasantly surprised that it worked as well it did on the first try.  I did make a goof and totally miss that the neck of the original part has a very slight taper - only about 1 millimeter smaller at the top - which caused my version to be too big.  It also didn't help that my measurements were a little off, but the taper was the biggest problem.  I shaved down the excess material with a Dremel to get it to fit in the monitor mounting cavity.  It holds up well but I need to trim down the part a little more to get the monitor to fit all the way down on the neck.  I have since purchased a nicer set of digital calipers and now that I'm aware of the taper, hopefully version two will be a better (and final) fit.  \r\n\r\n*WARNING* - If you happen to stumble upon this page, DO NOT print this part and expect it to work without some modifications.  I hope to have an update in the next few weeks.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
