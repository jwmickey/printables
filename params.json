{"name":"Printables","tagline":"Solid modeling objects intended for 3d printing","body":"PRINTABLES!\r\n===========\r\n\r\nI don't always create solid models, but when I do, I put them here.\r\n\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI took a few graphic design classes in college and cut my teeth on AutoCAD and SolidWorks.  This was the \r\nearly 2000's so the software has evolved a great deal and my knowledge of both how to use the software \r\nand principles behind them continue to erode.  However, as I've recently tried to create some parts of \r\ninterest I am pleasantly surprised at how much I seem to remember from \"the good ole' days\".\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst Project - Samsung Monitor Adapter\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nI wanted to mount my Samsung 24\" monitor on the wall using a 75mm VESA mount, but the S24B350 does not \r\nhave a mounting pattern on the body of any kind.  This is a great monitor but if I had been smart enough \r\nto check for this feature before purchasing I would have passed.  I found a steel adapter from a 3rd party \r\nvendor that appears to be great, but I thought this would be a great opportunity to play around with \r\nsolid modeling again and finally have something worth of sending to a 3D printer!\r\n\r\nI haven't yet printed the object yet, but I hope to be able to print using ABS plastic.  The first revision \r\nappears to be thick enough to hold, but I'm totally guessing on that front.  Hopefully I can either trim \r\ndown the actual material or print using a honeycomb fill patern to reduce fillament usage (or both) in a \r\nfuture revision.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
